Dropshipping
- A modern dropshipping e-commerce website with a simple, sleek, and responsive UI. The platform will allow users to browse products sourced from suppliers, 
add items to their cart, checkout securely with payment integration, track their orders, and manage their profile. The website will also have an admin interface for
managing products, orders, and supplier integrations. Additionally, it should include a "build-in-public" page where development updates and progress can be shared publicly.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
- Stripe account for payment processing
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dropshipping-website.git
   cd dropshipping-website
````

2. **Install dependencies for frontend and backend**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend` folders with the necessary secrets:

   ```env
   # Backend .env example
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   SUPPLIER_API_KEY=your_supplier_api_key
   ```

   ```env
   # Frontend .env example
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
   ```

4. **Run database migrations and seed**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Start development servers**

   * Frontend (Next.js):

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

   * Backend (Express):

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```

6. **Access the app**

   * Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   * Backend API: `http://localhost:4000/api`

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL schema is managed via Prisma ORM. Key models:

* **User**: Stores user info and authentication details
* **Product**: Product catalog with supplier association
* **Supplier**: Supplier information and API details
* **Order**: Customer orders with status tracking
* **OrderItem**: Items within an order
* **Payment**: Payment records linked to orders

Refer to `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` for full schema.

## API Endpoints

* `GET /api/products` - List all products
* `GET /api/products/:id` - Product details
* `POST /api/users/register` - User registration
* `POST /api/users/login` - User login
* `GET /api/orders` - Get user orders (auth required)
* `POST /api/orders` - Create a new order
* `POST /api/payments/create-intent` - Create payment intent (Stripe)
* Webhooks for payment status updates

---

## Authentication

* User authentication via NextAuth.js or JWT tokens
* Secure password hashing with bcrypt
* Role-based access control for admin vs customer routes
* Session management handled via JWT or NextAuth session cookies

---

## Payment Integration

* Stripe payment gateway integration for secure card payments
* Backend creates payment intents; frontend handles checkout UI
* Webhook endpoint to listen to Stripe events (payment success/failure)
* Order status updated automatically based on payment results

---

## Supplier Integration

* Background jobs to sync product catalog via supplier APIs
* Automatic forwarding of new orders to suppliers via API or email
* Supplier data and credentials stored securely
* Admin interface to manage suppliers and sync settings

---

## Deployment

* Frontend deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* Backend deployed as:

  * Serverless API routes on Vercel (preferred for simplicity), or
  * Separate Node.js server on Heroku, AWS, or similar
* Use environment variables in deployment dashboards to store secrets
* Configure Prisma to connect to production PostgreSQL database
